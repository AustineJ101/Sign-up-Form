# Sign-up Page

This is a simple sign up page built using HTMl and CSS. Through this project, I not only demonstrated the ability to structure and style a web page effectively but also showcased a strong understanding of form handling. This includes implementing form validation, input types, and enhancing user experience with clear visual feedback.

# Form Behavior
 - Required Fields: The form includes required attributes for various input fields, ensuring users cannot submit incomplete or empty information.

 - Form Validation: Input fields such as email and phone number use specific type attributes (e.g., email, tel) to validate the format of the entered data. Additionally, the minlength attribute on the password fields enforces a minimum length, preventing the user from submitting a password that is too short.

 - User Experience: To enhance usability, invalid inputs are visually indicated by a red outline, guiding users to correct their errors. Once valid information is entered, the input outlines turn blue, providing positive visual feedback that the data is correctly formatted.
